Information for the help application.

(All examples are shown using the Control Panel on the homepage.)


The Database contains {some} fields. They are:

	type 	-			Describes the type of item (i.e. snapins, form, enu etc...)
	app	-			is the tag for that item. (control_panel, address_book, attachments, textbox, and the like...)
	swfXsize -		the width of the SWF file in pixels
	swfYsize - 		the height of the SWF file in pixels
	ENGLISH - 		English Translations for all the text.
	FRENCH - 		Ditto
	GERMAN - 		Ditto
	ITALIAN - 		Ditto. Again.
	

	
To make a help page for an application you need:

	The type of application that it is (snapin)
	The application itself.	(control_panel)
	You call the application using the url:
	
		./apps/help/window/helpWindow?type={type}&amp;app={application}
	
	i.e.
	
		./apps/help/window/helpWindow?type=snapin&amp;app=control_panel
	
	You need at least some text in the ENGLISH field (it defaults to this field if all others are empty)



If you need a Flash animation:

	Make an SWF file using Wink.exe (and edit it to look pretty) 
	
	Render it using no Control Bar, and the SCAPA preloader (use F3 to open the settings)
	
	Save it in the help/flash folder as '{application}_{language}.swf'
	
	i.e. 'help/flash/control_panel_ENGLISH.swf' for the English version (CAPS the language)
	
	You need at least an english version, as it defaults to this is no others are found.
	
	Take note of the dimensions of the file (wink: Project>information) and enter them in the table
	(swfXsize and swfYsize) it use these to size the TD that it sita in, and resize the window on click.








Does it all make sense?
