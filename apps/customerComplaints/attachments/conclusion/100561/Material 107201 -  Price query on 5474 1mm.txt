Subject: 107201 - Price query on 5474 1mm

Hi Alison,

During our meeting with Jon on the 26th May 2011 and subsequent correspondence between 
Bill and Jon, the price of £241.05 has been visible on all spreadsheets.

As there has been some confusion I will confirm the price again on this email.  We will credit 
the difference between £241.05 and £174.71 for orders prior to today’s date.  

Regardless of Group level negotiations any new orders will only be accepted at £241.05 from 
Stokvis UK.  It is not commercially viable for us to continue to supply for less.

As from today the price is;

107201          1mm x 1200mm x 60m       £241.05

Quotation valid for 30 days and is subject to our terms and conditions.

Kind regards,

Dawn Baker

Dawn,

We have been invoiced £241.05 for 5474 1mm but the price we have been paying is £174.71

It is my understanding that no price increases should have been implemented on our account yet, as 
negotiations are on going at group level.

Please would you arrange for a credit to be raised against invoice 9100243947 to cover the over charge.

Many thanks
