Hello Jayne, Roy and Dragan,

Many thanks Jayne for your reply. Sorry for my delay, I was out a couple days and also was on sick 
leave. 

Regarding the request for compensation, let me explain a bit. First, I can understand such policy you 
describe, but as said, let me explain our standpoint here.

The reason I ask for this compensation, is that we have had many repeated cases from Scapa where the 
CoA’s have been missing. I am sure you and/or Roy are aware of this, as both me and Gun Gunnarsson 
have been chasing for the documentation every time it was missing. This have caused us a lot of extra 
work and also frustration, plus that we have to quarantine material which is not acc what is agreed upon. I 
cannot tell how many work hours we have spent on this handling, but I can say it is easy in the two figure 
range. Seen in this content, a compensation of EUR 110 is quite measely.
Most of the time we have not filed an official claim (even that I’ve could done so), instead we have just 
requested the CoA. In some cases I have filed an official claim, to get it documented and see proof of 
actions taken at Scapa, both in UK and Rorschach.

But let me also in all fairness say that I am very satisfied how you (Scapa) have handled the various filed 
claims. Sure, we have had a couple of them, but these have been handled in a proper manner and we 
have received proper reports. But the “black sheep” have been these CoA’s…

Regarding the sum you offer, I leave that up to you to decide; if you credit us what we ask for or what 
you offer. But I want you to clearly understand our standpoint and why we ask for compensation here!

Dragan: this is for your info. If you have questions etc, please give me a call.

Hello Fredrik

Many thanks for your email. It is good to hear that our corrective actions to this complaint seem to have 
finally resolved this problem. 

Normally we would not offer credit for penalties for not supplying documentation, however as a gesture of 
goodwill to our ongoing working relationship we can offer you a one off credit of €50. 

Please confirm by return that this is acceptable to you and Roy will raise the credit.

Regards

Hi Jayne and Roy

Can you please send me by email the requested credit note of EUR 110, as per the rejection report stated 
below.

As soon as I have received it, I will close this case as the CoA’s have been attached in the latest 
deliveries, and the actions thus are judged effective. Therefore I appreciate if I can get the credit asap, 
thanks!

Dear Jayne and Roy,

Many thanks for your reply and 8D, and sorry for my late reply in turn. What I miss though is the 
requested credit for EUR 110, as per the rejection report FH110621-1 update 110906 (see attached), which 
has already been sent to you.

As for the thickness of 5169, I have told Roy that we also require that the CoA’s also state the actual 
thickness for the delivered batches of the following artno’s: 
- KS 5169 1,5 mm black, 106867
- KS 5169 black 3 mm, 106869
- KS 5169 4,5 mm black, 106870

Unfortunately I have not heard back from Roy, but as the CoA’s for delivered material I checked contain 
the thickness, I see that this is implemented.

Hi Fredrik 
 
We have run through the process with both our sites in Dunstable and Rorschach. 
 
As the requests are not always being picked up by our despatch teams we have decided to 
involve our QA teams by asking them to review our daily despatch reports so that they can also 
pick up requests for c of As. 
 
Hopefully this double stage checking will ensure that requests are picked up before goods are 
despatched.  
 
Regards  
Jayne
