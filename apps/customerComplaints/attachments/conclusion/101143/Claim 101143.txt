Hi Arto,

Many thanks for this clarification.

I believe that it has been agreed that we will supply a 50% credit for these 408 rolls, by reducing the value of a 
current order line!

For information the price charged for these rolls in early 2010 was € 12.82 per roll.  Hence the total credit 
request would have been (408 rolls @ €12.82 ) = €5230.56 Total.  Therefore 50% ( 204 rolls ) would be 
€2615.28.

We are currently manufacturing your order 25792 as below:

Material 149107                2,560     ROL        62796    T002 Inside 19mm x 500m 3" Bags plain  ROR       PR00      13.20     
EUR        1                ROL        33,792.00

Our plan is to change this order line to read 2560 rolls @ €12178.41 per 1000 rolls.  This would give a new order 
total of €31176.73 for the 2560 rolls.   

This action will return the agreed 50% of the original claim.

Please confirm your agreement and we will update our paperwork.

Thanks & regards,

Roy

Hi Bengt,
I understand that you have now received a visit from our Dragan Vasic regarding settlement 
of the T002 claim.
As I understand we are going to reduce the value of a future order to take into consideration 
50 % of your debit dated 4/5/2011.  This will be recorded as responsible goodwill. 
<<1069_001.pdf>> 
To avoid any confusion can we confirm that the claim is for 408 rolls?
With this information we will organise the calculation and come back to you for approval.
Thanks for your confirmation in advance & regards,
Roy
