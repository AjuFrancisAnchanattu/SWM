Hi Fredrik,

We have now investigated the COA transaction process within our system and have made a number of 
modifications to the visibility of the text on the relevant documents.

This action, along with internal briefing to both technical & warehouse team members, will improve our 
response time.

Our 8D is attached for your records.

Apologies for the inconvenience & regards,

Roy

Hi Roy,
 
Thanks for your reply. Yes, I know that Scapa have emailed us the requested/missing CoA’s after we 
contacted you. 
 
But I am after the actual root cause why it happens, and that Scapa takes corrective actions to stop it 
from happen in the future. As you know, this fault have happened multiple times, and each time it takes 
extra time both for us and for Scapa.
 
Please let me know when you have the report with requested info. Many thanks!
 
 
Best regards / Med vänliga hälsningar

Hi Fredrik,
 
Thanks for this notification.
 
For information we were emailed requesting a copy of the COA relating to PO 32060 by Gun back on 
the 9/6/2011.  This was forwarded to Gun & also forwarded to Petra, on the same day, when we 
received an out of office from Gun. Only yesterday we received a mail  from Gun asking for a copy of 
the COA relating to the PO 32369.  This has now been prepared and is attached for your records.
 
We also attach a copy of the earlier ( 32060 ) COA if it helps, along with our complaint 
acknowledgement for the general Quality paperwork issue.
 
Our foam production colleagues will investigate our internal system and we will report back their 
findings as soon as they are available.
 
Thanks & regards,
 
Roy

Hello Roy,
 
We have in short time received shipments from Scapa where the CoA was missing, even that we state on 
our PO to Scapa that such CoA shall be enclosed the goods. Unfortunately Scapa have missed to attach 
certificates on quite a number of shipments lately, which cause us delays and extra work for us!
 
This time it was our order 32060 & 32369 where the logrolls of 5169 4.5mm miss CoA for adhesion value. 
We state on our PO the following text: "Note! Certificate of Analysis (CoA) shall be enclosed the shipment. 
The CoA shall also be faxed to Stokvis, attn: Warehouse Manager. 
CoA must specify art.no. , batch no and value of adhesion.
If CoA or the required information is missing, the shipment will not be accepted".
 
Because the CoA is missing, we must quarantine the material which halt our goods flow. Please 
investigate the reason why it fails from Scapas side and the CoA is not attached, and what actions will be 
taken to correct it. Please see attached rejection report FH110621-1 with all details. 
 
Also send me the CoA itself for batch C068 soonest possible to me and to emailadress 
lagerinleverans@stokvistapes.se
