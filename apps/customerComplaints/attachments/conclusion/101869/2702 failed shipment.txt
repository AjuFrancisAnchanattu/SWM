Morning Karin,
 
I hope you enjoyed a relaxing weekend!
 
Just to share with you the latest information regarding this delayed pallet from Ghislarengo to Stokvis 
Norway.
 
You will see from the note below that “Bring Logistics” are currently checking their various warehouses 
to locate this pallet.  They are hopeful of more information during the day!
 
“Bring logistics Norway cannot trace the pallet at the moment.
We do apologize for  the problem caused.
 
Mrs Ellen, at Bring logistics opened an official research of the Scapa pallet  in  all Bring  warehouses .
We hope to get good news on a Monday”
 
I have copied the Bring email address for your info: EllenKristin.Eriksen@bringlogistics.no
 
I will be in touch when more information is to hand.
 
Thanks & regards,
 
Roy
