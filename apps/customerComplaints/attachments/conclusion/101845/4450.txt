Roy,

We received 4 logs of 4450 against PO No 446548

One of these logs has about 2 metres within the roll that does not have any adhesive on.

I will send a sample of this to the address you are going to send to me but I urgently need to know 
when a replacement log can be here.

As discussed, I will let you have an official complaint later today, but I have to finish a couple of jobs 
first.

Thanks
